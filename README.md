### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Richard Li (He/Him), a sophomore at Olin College of Engineering, pursuing a degree in Engineering with Computing. I have experience with Python, Go, and C. 

Fun fact: [I write music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/46oNo84Ob0RXNWn3JVb5w7) ! And I never get to tell anyone because I'm just a plain 'ol software engineer on my resume :P
